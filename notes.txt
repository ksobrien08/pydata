user logs in and inputs favorite players for any sport (basketball, soccer, baseball, football, hockey)

web api to player stats and populate season and carrer averages(webapi,fantasy sites)

store data in database that is always populated
send weekly updates via email on favorite players
expand to maybe 3-5 favorite players
